# Fyta Assignment Project
## Description

This application developed for testing purposes, So I focused on **Structure**. The application
developed by **Bloc** state managment in MVVM. I try my best to implement UI part same on design.
The application take a photo or get a photo from Gallery and send it for www.plant.net for get most simulare planets.
U use Camera package for create camera surface in application.
I also use dotenv package for keep project secure so you cant view my key and base url. For run this project in your side you should add .env file to root and add both of key and baseurl to this file.
For animated loading I also use Lottie file. 
I also use Dio for getting data from backend.
